How we will accomplish this in a few weeks: We will use version control (either GitHub or
Unity’s own VCS) to stay up-to-date and synchronized. We will also use Discord to stay in
contact with one another. We will implement sprints to ensure that we are putting in a decent
amount of work per iteration. We plan on having a priority list of features to make sure that we
are implementing our plan that will result in a fun and interesting game even if we don’t finish all
of our intended objectives.
